	If for some reason those coordinates where round to ( 0,0 ) ( 2, 17 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 1, 9 ),
	there will be clearly a gap or overlap that was not intended.
	Even without rounding this effect takes place since there is always a minimum significant bit
	also when using doubles.

	If the user used as minimum accuracy 0.001, you need to choose Marge > 0.001
	The boolean engine scales up the input data with GetDGrid() * GetGrid() and rounds the result to
	integer, So (assuming GRID = 100 DGRID = 1000)  a vertex of 123.001 in the user data will
	become 12300100 internal.
	At the end of the algorithm the internal vertexes are scaled down again with GetDGrid() * GetGrid(),
	so 12300103 becomes 123.00103 eventually.
	So indeed the minimum accuracy might increase, you are free to round again if needed.
