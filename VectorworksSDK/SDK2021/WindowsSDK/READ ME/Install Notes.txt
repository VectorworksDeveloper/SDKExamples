====================================
INSTALL NOTES
for VectorWorks SDK 21.0.0
September, 2015
====================================


1) Download the VectorWorks SDK and decompress it onto your harddrive.
----------------------------------------------------------
We distribute the SDK ZIP files for both Macintosh Windows. The files
contained in the Mac and Windows distribution are identical with two exceptions:

	The Windows text files use CR/LF as the line terminator to conform
	to Windows standards, whereas the Mac text files use CR.

	The Windows ZIP archives do not contain the Macintosh resource
	files that are used to generate the *.qtr files.  The sample plug-ins
	will build and run on Windows using only the Windows ZIP download.  
	However, in order to modify the resources or develop new plug-ins, 
	Windows developers must download the Mac SDK in addition to the Windows SDK.



2) Install the development environment.
----------------------------------------
To develop Plug-ins with the VectorWorks SDK, you must purchase development
tools for Windows and install the free development tools for the Macintosh.


MACINTOSH:
----------

The minimum version of Mac OS X that you can develop on is Mac OS X 10.9.

a.) Run the Xcode Tools 6.1.1 installer from the DVD.

b.) A dialog will come up welcoming you. Click the Continue button.

c.) Select your Language (English is recommended). You will be asked to agree with the
    software license agreement, click Agree if you do.

d.) The installer program will automatically select your start up disk as the location
    to install the Xcode Tools. This is fine. Click Continue.

e.) In the following dialog, the following items should have their checkboxes checked:
	- Developer Tools Essentials
	- System Tools
	- UNIX Development Support

f.) Click the Install button. You will be asked for the password used to
    log into your Macintosh.



WINDOWS:
--------
Install Microsoft "Visual Studio 2012".


3) Build the sample code
--------------------------
The SDK consists of all the library, source, and header files required to build
Plug-Ins on a single platform, as well as a few sample projects. These sample
projects demonstrate the preferred method to set up a tool, menu, or custom
object plug-in. Any sample in the SDK should contain a Xcode project file (.xcodeproj) 
or a Visual Studio (.vcproj) file only if we expect it to build correctly on that
platform.

The SDK contains samples located inside the SDK folder at: \Source\Samples



Each sample plug-in file will be built in its own sample directory.  Copy these
plug-in files into your "VectorWorks/Plug-ins" folder to use them.  You will
also need to add them to a Workspace before they are available within
VectorWorks.
